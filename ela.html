            <p>Imagine a world where prejudices run rampant and overshadow scientific breakthroughs. In this world, biases forge humanities future, determining wether we will be wiped out, or spared. This is a reality in the world of <em>Frankenstein</em>, a novel by Mary Shelley.</p>

            <h3>Thesis:</h3>
            <p>In the classic novel Frankenstein by Mary Shelley, a major theme of implicit bias is explored through the harsh judgment that is shown towards the monster by humanity.</p>

            <br>
            <p>I chose this thesis as it is relevant all throughout the novel. This idea of pretty privileges is a main point that reoccurs as the novel goes on. Additionally, these biases shaped the creature and Victorâ€™s destiny. If the prejudices were less harsh or nonexistent the story would have been completely different.</p>
